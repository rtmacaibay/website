# Personal Website

This is my personal website created from a starter Gatsby template. I have since added additional code and fixes to the CSS files. https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension

## Preview

## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
<br/>
`gatsby new gatsby-starter-dimension https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.

To run my website, `gatsby build` also works.
